# Free Observability for Test Automators Tutorial

This is a fork of the fantastic [free Selenium WebDriver for Java tutorial](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/selenium-webdriver-tutorial-java/) created by Angie Jones on Test Automation University.

This fork acts as the course material for an upcoming course on observability for test automators.

We will cover intermediate to advanced topics in monitoring and observability including:
* Creating a basic build pipeline in GitHub Actions
* Generating metrics via bash commands
* Running metrics infrastructure locally via docker-compose
* Generating json events from a build pipeline
